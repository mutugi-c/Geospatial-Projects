    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
      During the master's program, Chris has been involved in various types of
      projects, ranging from a global scale to the grassroots level. Some of
      these projects include Erodibility analysis, Mobility in Estonia, and the
      #30DayMapChallenge.

    <h2>Erodibility Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      This task aimed at identifying croplands that were susceptible to erosion,
      using slope and soil texture as the factors for erosion. Classical GIS
      suitability analysis was employed, with the goal being to identify
      croplands in Kenya that are located on steep slopes with finer soil
      texture, hence making them susceptible to erosion. QGIS version 3.16.11
      was used, and the land cover data obtained from ESA Land Cover 300m
      product â€“ ESA Climate Change Initiative.

    <h2>Flow Map</h2>
    <p>
      A flow map of movements between territorial communities in Estonia was
      created using OD (Origin-Destination) matrices containing spatial and
      non-spatial details about where territorial movements began and ended, and
      the number of regular movers.
