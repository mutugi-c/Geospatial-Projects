      <p>
        During the master's program, Chris has been involved in various types of
        projects, ranging from a global scale to the grassroots level. Some of
        these projects include Erodibility analysis, Mobility in Estonia, and
        the #30DayMapChallenge.

        <h2>Erodibility Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          This task aimed at identifying croplands that were susceptible to
          erosion, using slope and soil texture as the factors for erosion.
          Classical GIS suitability analysis was employed, with the goal being
          to identify croplands in Kenya that are located on steep slopes with
          finer soil texture, hence making them susceptible to erosion. QGIS
          version 3.16.11 was used, and the land cover data obtained from ESA
          Land Cover 300m product â€“ ESA Climate Change Initiative.

        <p>
          The Elevation data was from SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission)
          Tile Grabber, the Kenyan border shapefile from the GADM database,
          while the World Soil Database was obtained from ISRIC Soil Data Hub.

        <p>
          Kenya has an estimated 48.1% of its total land area under agricultural
          use. 9.8% of the said land is estimated to be arable; crops are
          replanted after each harvest, 0.9% under permanent crops; crops not
          replanted after each harvest, such as coffee and tea, while the
          remaining 37.4% of agricultural land is made up of permanent pastures;
          land with herbaceous forage that is cultivated or grows naturally (CIA
          World Factbook, 2021). Classical GIS can thus be applied in carrying
          out simple erodibility analyses.

        <p>
          A flow map of movements between territorial communities in Estonia was
          created using OD (Origin-Destination) matrices containing spatial and
          non-spatial details about where territorial movements began and ended,
          and the number of regular movers.
